# config.yaml (User manages keys here, be careful committing)
# We might want to keep config.yaml example but ignore real keys?
# Usually we ship config.yaml.example. For now, we ignore everything local/secret.
# But config.yaml is the main config. Let's ignore it if it contains keys, or assume user manages it.
# Given it has keys now, better ignore it.
